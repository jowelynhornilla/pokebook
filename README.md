# PokeBook

PokeBook is a Pokémon-themed application that utilizes the PokeAPI (<https://pokeapi.co/>) as its data source. The primary functionality of the app is to display a paginated list of Pokémon cards, allowing users to browse through the various Pokémon available.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Directory

**Components**: contains reusable components that can be used throughout the application. These components are designed to be modular and independent, making them easy to reuse and maintain.

**Constants**: stores global variables that are used across the application. These variables can include configuration settings, API endpoints, or any other constants that are required in multiple parts of the app.

**Hooks**: you can find custom hooks that encapsulate common logic or functionality used in multiple components.

**Layout**: contains layout pages that define the overall structure and arrangement of components for different sections or pages of the application.

**Services**: houses API endpoint instances or client configurations that are used to communicate with backend services.

**Types**: stores global interfaces or types used throughout the application.

**Pages**: contains individual page components that represent the different views or screens of your application. Each page component typically includes specific functionality and is responsible for rendering relevant components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
